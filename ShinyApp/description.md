## Description

This app demonstrates how to use Shiny for get and show stock data using R and Quandl package.

The `symbol` checkbox field is stock symbol code. And the `date range` is the time time for get data. Each time you interact with the app by changing the values of the inputs or by switching between the tabs, the plot gets updated to reflect the current state of the widgets.
